### About
A collection of reference machine learning and optimization models for enterprise operations: marketing, pricing, supply chain.

### Illustrative Example 
*Strategic price optimization using reinforcement learning*

   * Nearest Neighbor Item-based Collaborative Filtering
   * Item2Vec Model using NLP Methods (word2vec)
   * Customer2Vec Model using NLP Methods (doc2vec)
* Pricing and Assortment
  * Markdown Price Optimization
  * Dynamic Pricing using Thompson Sampling
  * Dynamic Pricing with Limited Price Experimentation
  * Price Optimization using Reinforcement Learning (DQN)
* Supply Chain

### Approach
* The most basic models come from Introduction to Algorithmic Marketing book. Book's website - https://algorithmicweb.wordpress.com/
* More advanced models use deep learning techniques to analyze event sequences (e.g. clickstream) and reinforcement learning for optimization (e.g. safety stock management policy)
* Almost all models are based on industrial reports and real-life case studies
